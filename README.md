# SPA Experiment – React + Vite

## Objective
To design and develop a basic Single Page Application (SPA) using a modern frontend framework and understand client-side rendering and reusable UI components.

---

## Description
This project demonstrates frontend development using **React** and **Vite** through two structured experiments:

- **Experiment-1** focuses on building a basic Single Page Application with routing and multiple pages.
- **Experiment-2** focuses on designing reusable UI components and integrating them into existing pages.

The application follows a component-based architecture and enables smooth navigation without page reloads.

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- Vite
- JavaScript (ES6)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Git & GitHub
- Netlify (Deployment)

---

## Project Structure
- `components/`
  - `Button.jsx`
  - `TextField.jsx`
  - `Select.jsx`
  - `Rating.jsx`
  - `Checkbox.jsx`
- `pages/`
  - `Home.jsx`
  - `About.jsx`
  - `Contact.jsx`
- `App.jsx`
- `main.jsx`

## Experiment-1: Basic SPA Development

### Aim
To create a basic Single Page Application using React and Vite.

### Key Features
- Client-side routing using React Router
- Navigation without page reload
- Component-based UI
- Fast development using Vite

---

## Experiment-2: UI Design Components

### Aim
To design reusable UI components and integrate them into existing SPA pages.

### Tasks Performed
1. Created **5 UI design components**:
   - Button
   - TextField
   - Select
   - Rating
   - Checkbox

2. Copied **3 components/pages from Experiment-1**:
   - Home
   - About
   - Contact

3. Integrated **all 5 UI components** into the copied pages:
   - Forms enhanced using TextField, Select, and Checkbox
   - Actions handled using Button component
   - User interaction improved using Rating component
   - Uniform and reusable UI across pages

---

## Features
- Reusable and modular UI components
- Clean component structure
- SPA navigation without reload
- Responsive UI design
- Scalable React architecture

---

## Deployment
The project is deployed on Netlify.

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this project, I learned:
1. Fundamentals of Single Page Applications
2. React component creation and reuse
3. UI component integration across pages
4. Importance of modular and reusable code
5. Project setup and optimization using Vite
6. Version control using GitHub
7. Deployment of React applications using Netlify

## Conclusion
This experiment provided hands-on experience in modern frontend development. Experiment-1 built the foundation of SPA concepts, while Experiment-2 enhanced understanding of reusable UI components and scalable React application design.
