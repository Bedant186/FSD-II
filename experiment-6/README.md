# Experiment 6: Handling Forms and Validations in Frontend

## Experiment Number
**Experiment No: 6**

## UID
**23BDA70122**

---

## Experiment Title
**Handling Forms and Validations in Frontend using Material UI**

---

## Aim
To design and implement a responsive frontend form using **Material UI (MUI)** components with **built-in and custom validations**, ensuring correct user input and improved user experience.

---

## Description
This experiment focuses on creating a modern and interactive form using **Material UI (MUI)** in React.  
The form includes multiple input elements such as **Text Fields, Radio Buttons, Checkboxes, and a Submit Button**, along with **frontend validations** to ensure data correctness before submission.

The validations are implemented using **React state management**, preventing invalid data submission and displaying appropriate error messages to the user.

---

## Functional Requirements
The form includes the following components:
- Text Fields for Name, Email, and Password
- Radio Buttons for Gender selection
- Checkbox for accepting Terms and Conditions
- Submit Button for form submission
- Error messages for validation feedback

---

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**
- **Material UI (MUI v5)**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **CSS**
- **Netlify** (for deployment)
- **GitHub** (for version control)

---

## Features Implemented
- Responsive form layout using Material UI
- Controlled components using React `useState`
- Email format validation using Regular Expressions
- Password length validation
- Mandatory field validation
- Checkbox validation for terms acceptance
- User-friendly error messages
- Clean and professional UI design
